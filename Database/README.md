# Databases

Under this folder, you will find sub-folders containing the SQL scripts to create the necessary tables for the different databases used by the system. There will also be a brief README file explaining how to set up the database and general information about it.

## General Setup

For the general setup of the databases, you will need to have a PostgreSQL server running. You can find the instructions to install it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The system was developed and tested using Postgres 16.
