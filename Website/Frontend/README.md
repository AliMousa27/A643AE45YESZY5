```
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit355/2023/student-teams/dit356-2023-12/toothtrek.git
```

*Step 2*
Change directory into the folder called "Frontend" by running the following command 
cd ```/toothtrek/Website/Frontend```

then run the command ```flutter pub get```

*Step 3*
In the same terminal, run the command ```flutter run -d chrome``` to run the application on your web browser.

### Optional
